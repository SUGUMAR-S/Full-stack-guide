/*Middleware:
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
-> Execute any code.
-> Make changes to the request and the response objects.
-> End the request-response cycle.
-> Call the next middleware function in the stack.
-> If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
